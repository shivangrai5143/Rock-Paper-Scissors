# Rock-Paper-Scissors
  I developed a classic Rock-Paper-Scissors game using vanilla JavaScript to create an engaging, interactive user experience. This project showcases my skills in core game logic, event handling, and dynamic DOM manipulation to provide real-time feedback and score tracking against a computer opponent.

Standard Description (for a portfolio or project list)
This project brings the timeless game of Rock-Paper-Scissors to the web. Built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, this application allows a user to play against a computer opponent.

Key features include:

Interactive UI: Clean, intuitive buttons for the user to make their selection (rock, paper, or scissors). ✊✋✌️

Core Game Logic: JavaScript functions determine the winner of each round based on the classic rules.

Real-time Feedback: The user interface dynamically updates after each turn to display the player's choice, the computer's randomly generated choice, the outcome of the round (win, lose, or draw), and the current score.

DOM Manipulation: The project heavily utilizes JavaScript to directly manipulate the HTML and CSS, creating a seamless and responsive experience without needing to reload the page.

This project was an excellent exercise in fundamental front-end development, reinforcing my understanding of conditional logic, event listeners, and creating an engaging user-facing application from scratch.
